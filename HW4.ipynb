    "1. We explored **bootstrapping**, a statistical method that involves resampling with replacement to estimate the sampling distribution of a statistic, often used for estimating confidence intervals or the standard error when theoretical distributions are unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We clarified the difference between the **standard deviation (SD)** and the **standard error of the mean (SEM)**:\n",
    "   - **SD** measures the spread of data points within the sample.\n",
    "   - **SEM** estimates the precision of the sample mean as a reflection of the population mean and decreases with larger sample sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We discussed how **SEM can be estimated using bootstrapping**, providing a non-parametric approach for calculating SEM when traditional assumptions (e.g., normality) donâ€™t hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. We framed the distinction between SD and SEM in terms of **sample vs. population**:\n",
    "   - SD is a **descriptive statistic** based on the sample.\n",
    "   - SEM is an **inferential statistic** aimed at understanding the accuracy of the sample mean in estimating the true population mean."
